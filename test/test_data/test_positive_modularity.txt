# Custom graph designed for positive modularity communities
# 4 variables = 8 nodes total
# Nodes 1-4: positive literals x1, x2, x3, x4  
# Nodes 5-8: negative literals ¬x1, ¬x2, ¬x3, ¬x4
# 
# Community 1: nodes [1,2,5,6] (x1, x2, ¬x1, ¬x2)
# Community 2: nodes [3,4,7,8] (x3, x4, ¬x3, ¬x4)
#
# Very heavy internal connections, minimal external connections

# Very strong internal connections in Community 1 (x1, x2 group)
