# Plan for 3-SAT and Community Detection

### Need to:
- Create 3-SAT instances of any size.
- Convert a 3-SAT instance to an edge-weighted graph.
- Run community detection on the graph.
- Run my algorithm on the communities.

## Breakdown:

# Create 3-SAT instances of any size.
- Specify a number of variables.
- Specify a number of clauses.
- Generate random clauses or specify them manually.
- **Use Markdown format for human-readable input files!**

## Proposed Markdown Format for 3-SAT Instances

### Example: `3sat_instance_01.md`
```markdown
# 3-SAT Instance: Random 5-variable, 10-clause

## Variables
- x₁, x₂, x₃, x₄, x₅

## Clauses
1. (x₁ ∨ ¬x₂ ∨ x₃)
2. (¬x₁ ∨ x₄ ∨ ¬x₅)
3. (x₂ ∨ x₃ ∨ x₄)
4. (¬x₃ ∨ x₅ ∨ x₁)
5. (x₄ ∨ ¬x₁ ∨ ¬x₂)
6. (¬x₄ ∨ x₂ ∨ x₅)
7. (x₃ ∨ ¬x₅ ∨ ¬x₁)
8. (x₅ ∨ x₁ ∨ ¬x₃)
9. (¬x₂ ∨ ¬x₄ ∨ x₃)
10. (x₁ ∨ x₅ ∨ ¬x₄)

## Metadata
- Variables: 5
- Clauses: 10
- Ratio: 2.0 (clauses/variables)
- Generated: random
- Satisfiable: unknown
```

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Create 3-SAT Generator
- Function to generate random instances
- Function to parse markdown 3-SAT files
- Function to validate 3-SAT instances

### 2. Convert to Graph Format
- Parse clauses to extract literal co-occurrences
- Generate edge weights (frequency of co-occurrence)
- Output to our standard `.txt` graph format

### 3. Analysis Pipeline
- Load markdown 3-SAT → Convert to graph → Community detection → Algorithm

## Advantages of Markdown Format
- **Human readable** - Easy to understand and verify
- **Documented** - Can include metadata, notes, and analysis
- **Version controllable** - Git-friendly format
- **Extensible** - Can add satisfying assignments, analysis results, etc.
- **Research friendly** - Perfect for academic work and publications
