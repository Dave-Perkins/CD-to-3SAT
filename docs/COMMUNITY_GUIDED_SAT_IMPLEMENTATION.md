## 🔍 Algorithm Implementation

### Core Algorithm Flow

```
1. Parse 3-SAT Instance (Markdown → SAT3Instance)
                ↓
2. Convert to Graph (SAT3Instance → Graph Format)
                ↓
3. Run Community Detection (Graph → Communities + Modularity)
                ↓
4. Sort Communities by Contribution (Highest to Lowest)
                ↓
5. Generate Assignment Strategy:
   - For each community (in order):
     - Sort nodes by edge weight
     - Assign variables: literal → true, negation → false
                ↓
6. Validate Assignment (Check if satisfies original formula)
                ↓
7. Compare with Traditional SAT Solver (Optional)
```
